# Ethical Use Policy

- **Lawful Research Only**: The toolkit enforces and documents safeguards against unauthorized surveillance or data exfiltration.
- **Opt-In Advanced Features**: Potentially unsafe operations (e.g., low-level packet crafting) are disabled by default and require explicit CLI flags acknowledging local-only usage.
- **No Malware**: The project does not provide code for malicious payload delivery, command and control, or exploitation.
- **Transparency**: Documentation explains every algorithm, including false-positive and false-negative considerations to prevent misuse.
- **Attribution & Provenance**: Watermarking modules support audit trails to prove media authenticity and tamper evidence.
